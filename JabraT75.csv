- Great sound, nicely balanced eq (good bass but not overdone)
- Very small form factor, fits completely inside my ear. Smallest rubber tip a great match for small ear canals
- Small containing case, fits nicely in my pocket
- Decent mic pickup, especially for something that is hidden deep inside your ear (I guess adding bone conduction could improve on that.)
- Decent ambient noise cancellation considering the tiny bud size (it was a bit of an afterthought for Jabra for this model as it came in a firmware update.)
My only worry was that after about 2 years one ear (the right one) started dropping out. However I found a group post saying that it could be fixed by cleaning at tiny hole between the charging conductors and the ear with a needle or toothpick. And lo and behold it fixed the problem. (I would have given a significantly lower rating if I hadn't been able to fix that.)
I will probably buy Jabra again when these get to the end of their useful life",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 7, 2023",0,Verified Purchase,

You are getting a hot deal for $150+ headphones.,"I know people are usually hesitant to buy used or renewed products, but I bought these in April 2021 and they are FANTASTIC!!! Roughly a 2-year lifespan with several benefits.

ANC:
The audio canceling is great, and the fact that you can turn on ""HearThrough"" mode if you want to hear noises outside of the earbuds is SUPER helpful for a work environment, or for people like me sometimes who struggle to breath when they can't hear what is outside of them. Let me tell ya, when they say these are noise-canceling, they are NOT kidding. My boss once had to yell my name very loud from across the warehouse for me to even realize there was any outside sound, and he yells loud.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality, I've found, is fantastic. I love the bass on these bad boys, and was very rarely disappointed at the audio quality (which is easily fixed by adjusting settings in the app). Unless you're an audiophile or hate bass, you will love the sound quality. There is also LOTS of customization. You can freely adjust the bass, treble, middle, etc, to fit your needs.

Battery:
The lifetime is fantastic! Though I did have some issues with the automatic power off when put in the case, and with case battery life near the end of my 2-year use, the battery life is super for most of the time you use these. Just enough battery to either get you through an entire 8 hour shift, or almost there. If you put them in the case while you eat or do other things, guaranteed to get you through the day on a single charge.

However, I think everyone who buys these should know the following things:
Warranty:
You do not have a warranty with Jabra when you purchase these. If they stop working, Jabra will not assist with a return or replacement (probably also because they aren't the seller here). I don't think Jabra
is wrong for this either, as these are used. But just be aware that buying these you do not get the Jabra Warranty.

Lifespan:
As for their lifespan, about 2 years. Based on personal experience and reading several reviews, it seems that after ~2 years, the left earbud gives out. I think this is a small price to pay for these extremely cheap earbuds. Just be prepared for the left earbud to get messed up after roughly 2 years.

Fit:
Based on several reviews, some people seem to dislike the fit of these. I have never had this problem, as they seldom fall out if you use the right-sized earbud end. Up to you to make this call, but you should be able to return them promptly if they don't fit.

Considering everything here, I think these are definitely worth a buy. Again, you are getting them for a STUPID cheap price.",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 4, 2023",0,Verified Purchase,

I really did not use them that much, but about a year in I noticed that every once in a while the right ear would quit working. 6 months ago I started running again, and I noticed the problem getting worse. I was using the hear-through mode, so I switched it off and the problem got better. The kept getting progressively worse to the point that after a 5 minute warm up, before the run, I would mostly not have my right ear sounds. I googled it and found sometimes a reset helped problems like this. Tried that, no success. Tried customer support - they were very responsive BTW. They gave me lots of tests to try, still no luck. So they suggested I get warranty support and sent me a link for that. After going two rounds with warranty support for things they needed, they abruptly denied the warranty replacement: ‚ÄúWe regret to inform you that the reseller Amazin Group you purchased from is not authorized to sell Jabra products‚Äù. I bought this from Amazon and Jabra refused warranty support.

At some point however, the left earbud lost all or most of it volume for no particular reason, there is a reddit post by a user that shows how to fix this but at least 30-40 people have had the same issue so it is not just me, it is a common issue among the 75t's.

I have taken great care of my earbud, regularly cleaned, never subjected to water or heavy moisture etc. and yet this issue is recurring. I was able to fix it however the ANC has ceased functioning about the same time as the left earbud lost its volume and the earbuds are still not as loud as they used to be.

As someone who does not particularly care or distinguish between quality/volume of sound, I found myself borrowing my partner's headphones more and more because of the lacklustre volume and issues with the 75t. If this had occurred after 2+ years, I would have been happy but 8-9 months is not long enough to justify the expense.

If you are thinking of purchasing a product in the 75/85t line, I would not recommend it due to the fragility of the earbuds for the price point. In saying that, I will be holding off purchasing another pair of earbuds for as long as possible so I can get as much value out of my current pair but they are certainly not ideal compared to other products.",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 10, 2023",0,,

It‚Äôs a bit weird to hear myself talk with it but the audio mic on it is really good and I dont have to talk as loud as when I‚Äôm using my laptop.

**UPDATE**
Updating to one rating now that I am unable to get any kind of replacement. Jabra says this is an unauthorized seller and therefore the warranty is void. Even though the seller says they do refund broken equipment (with a 20-50% ""restocking"" fee, are you kidding?), when you try to initiate a refund it says you have to talk to Amazon instead because Amazon ""shipped"" it. So basically, go spend your money at an authorized dealer and don't waste it here.

Comparing other in ear headphones.
Apple AirPod pro would feel so less audio quality when you compare them with 75t. Powerbeats has less base than 75t.

Only downside is they are bit low if you are using for calling over phone.
Active noise cancelling is just fine not great as Bose qc35 or AirPod pros.
Hearing music, watching movies no audio delay, can be used along running, they won‚Äôt fall, and jabra app is also great where you can customize. Also a great fan of jabra‚Äôs buttons instead of touch sensors.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lAPMWHStL.88.jpg

Eventually, though, one of the earbuds will just stop producing sound. Every other feature continues to work, but they will not play any sound at all. For me, it was the left one, but I've seen others complain about the right one. The connection was good. The features that were based on pulling the earbud out of my ear worked. The buttons worked. The issue is apparently a flaw that causes the speaker to not work if there's any gunk inside a tiny hole next to the charging connectors. I assumed it was earwax, but I've seen other owners claim it is glue that softens from your body heat and flows out of place. Either way, I followed the advice of others who encountered the problem and attempted to clean it out, but after it's happened for the third time in just over a year of light use, I can't get it to work again. Jabra does not acknowledge the issue. Customer support will insist you try various things that amount to trying to correct a nonexistent problem with the wireless connection instead of the physical problem with the speaker.

Based on 6 months of ~daily usage with Nexus 3 phone and Dell laptop w/ linux. Overall these earbuds work well. No issues to setup with either device. Internal battery lasts ~4 hours. The charging case will top up reasonably well over a lunch break. I've been recharging the case ~weekly.

Only slight downside is limited range, even for a bluetooth device. Phone has to be in my pocket.

I became a fan. Other's didn't like how bass heavy it was, but to me it was perfect and the app comes with an equalizer that can even out the sound the way you like it. Better than most of the equalizers that come on your sound program apps. I go to the gym 5 days a week and only one time had a problem with one of the coming out. Now after just three months they were working fine and then the next day for some reason the left ear bud went close to dead. There was little sound, but if I jiggled it just right the sound came back for a quick moment and then went away. It's like there's a connection loose inside the bud, which seems to me almost impossible.

I read other reviews and people were saying these were long lasting, but apparently that's not the case since after I googled I see multiple posts with people having left ear bud problems and returning them. I was originally going to buy the newest Galaxy bean buds or whatever they are called.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Keaton Farquhar,N/A, Great Besides the Distortion,"I ordered these after reading loads of reviews, and was incredibly excited to try an expensive pair of wireless earbuds. When they arrived they sounded great, the Jabra app was useful, the noise cancellation was very cool but after about two days I began to notice distortion in the left earbud, particularly when listening to podcasts. I gave it a few more days before deciding to return them, assuming they must be damaged in some way.

I ordered another of the same headphones only to have the same problem occur. After a bit of research, it seems this is not a completely uncommon problem with these. I contacted Jabra support who advised me to update the firmware and try a reset. I followed all their instruction with no luck, and the distortion seemed to be getting worse.

It was very frustrating; besides the distortion and crackling, they're great earbuds, super comfortable, long battery life, they sound good, maybe not as loud as i would have liked them to be but still sounded lovely.

I've returned the second pair and i'm going to try another brand.

First, I had lots of problems with the left earbud. The left earbud occasionally just stops working. By some magic of just leaving it be, it eventually starts again -- but there's no quick solution here, and the recommendations I read basically said, ""Let it run out of battery and then recharge.""

Eventually, the right earbud stopped working, and there's no fix for this. I tried to disconnect and reconnect to my phone, as support recommends. Unfortunately, because the right earbud doesn't work, I now have no way to reconnect it. So, about 15 months after purchase, I'm left with a dud set of earbuds.

I can't recommend these earbuds given how finicky and unreliable they've been, and I'd be timid about recommending or trying any of the other Jabra earbuds given these issues don't seem uncommon based on Google searches.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on July 29, 2021",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,

I ordered a warehouse deal product which says Used-like New. But the product is no where close to like new.. it has multiple scratches and dents on the case and the earbuds itself.
The ear plugs were also full of dirt and ear wax used by someone else (assumed it would atleast be disinfected and cleaned before reselling)
I wish I had clicked pictures of the dirt before I cleaned it with disinfectant wipes.
This was my first order with Amazon warehouse deal and would never try it again.
Worst customer experience.
Cost wise it was only $20 cheaper than a new one available. I wasted my time and really disappointed.
Will be definitely returning this back.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Pricewatcher,N/A, Great when they work. Support? Not great.,"Great when they work. Excellent sound quality and amazing noise cancellation. Lots of sync and pairing issues right from the start, but they were manageable (if annoying). Mine finally failed after only three months of light (1-2hrs/day, indoor) use though - left bud started cutting out and dropping to 20% volume. Troubleshooting with support took over a week, then they said I needed to replace them (under warranty). After finally providing them with a receipt that they‚Äôd accept, they told me that they wouldn‚Äôt send my replacement buds until 10+ days after they received my faulty pair back. I‚Äôve been without them for over a month now, bought a cheaper pair from a competitor that work well-enough.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,N/A, Does not really work well with two phones,"Connectivity is one of the worst that I ever used in my life. I got these earbuds to use with both my work and personal phone. Since the day j started using them, every conversation I had on a call was a struggle for other party to hear me. The only time it works flawlessly is when you are not moving and strictly confined to a spot.

When I leave the earbuds in the ear with both phones configured, I constantly hear connect / disconnected every few minutes with both my phone's in my pocket.

Have been using Bose sound sport wireless for almost 3 years and it started to give away. Never had an issue with both my phone's and conversations were clear and no complaints. I'm going to get one more pair of Bose now.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Elizabeth,N/A, Good but underwhelming for the price,"Pros: Audio output is clear, decent bass. Build quality and battery life is good, on both the buds and the charging case. The Jabra app is really handy for configuring settings on the buds, and allows the buds' firmware to be updated too. The 'hear through' feature is probably useful but overkill for me, seems to work well though.

Cons: Microphone isn't great but it's sufficient. Buds are a little large for my ears. The buds can be finicky to set up with your phone - sometimes the Jabra app glitches out - and in general behave inconsistently when establishing and keeping Bluetooth connections.

Honestly not that much better than some mid-tier wireless buds on the market right now that cost half the price. For a direct competitor with airpods, I expected comparable quality to airpods. Not worth the $200 in my opinion BUT they are good

Also worth noting is that the first pair of these I owned, the microphone was faulty and barely picked up any input.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Wayner Lung,N/A, YAAAY!!,"Very very very very VERY good pair of earbuds. The sound quality is perfect and its bass, ughhhhhh, its so good and really strong without overpowering the mids and the highs. This is perfect for anyone who likes really strong bass, and for people who would like a little bit more bass to their music. Considering the price point though I feel like some other areas should be improved such as making both earbuds masters instead of master/slave, having the ability to turn off auto-pause, etc.

As for comfortability it fits very well in my ears. It doesn't fall when I shake my head rigorously, although it gets my ears sore usually after 4 hours of use due to my small ears

First impressions - The first time I noticed was the thumping noise in my ear while wearing it and doing any walking, running, or the vibrations from a car whenever I rest my head. I find it pretty annoying and I have to deal with it while listening to music. I don't think i heard the thumping noise in my other wired in-ear earbuds and I think its dues to how deep the tips are in the ear. In my wired earbuds it was pretty deep in there and could barely hear any thumping, but the Jabras are a bit loud since its not that deep in my ear. I don't know what the reason is, but this is just my speculation.

Overall, I love the jabra elite 75t even though getting it used.

EDIT:

After a while of use the thumping noise I heard was gone. I guess I needed some getting used to",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on October 13, 2020",0,Verified Purchase,

- Battery life worse than AirPods, but can still last a whole day with constant playing
- Hands-free (microphone) quality is low","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RKe+Wu8kL.88.jpg

2.0 out of 5 stars,MaloryArcher,N/A, Had so much potential!,"Play Video
¬†I reeeeally wanted to like these but ended up returning them after testing them for about a month.. The reviews on here are accurate. I love the case, the magnetic features where it snaps in. Loved the lights indicating charging and Bluetooth connectivity. I loved the size. I loved the feature to hear outside sounds and my voice over calls or while using music and going for runs/walks. I liked that as soon as you take one bud out (say to talk to someone) the buds would automatically pause your music. I liked the tap buttons, they were very clickable. Loved the USB-c. The app was great.

However it's main function - to play music/audio - did not work. The sound quality was a letdown. They were cutting in and out. My old, wired Apple earbuds played better quality. The Jabra set also kinda gave me headaches after using for 30+ mins and I never had volume past half. I have small ears and I tried both the small and medium sized buds. Had these been 100$ cheaper, I would have just lived with it and kept them. But they aren't worth the current price point.

I have another set, Bose wireless headset that has the neck wire. Had it for over a year and I've never had issues with connectivity or cutting in and out over Bluetooth. Nor any issues with odd sounds or static while listening to music and calls. With the Jabra ones, I had issues immediately and all the time. I tried the software updates & resets and all like the website states, but still had issues. I always had my phone right next to me so there's no reason why they should have ever cut out.

My only complaint is that they have trouble cutting out sometimes as a result of poor connection, it depends on the position of your phone relative to your body.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Superbeeb,N/A, The best headphone is the one you use....,"I've owned multiple headphones/earbuds in the $100 - $200 range. That's sort of the sweet spot for me in terms of performance vs value. Also if something happens to one of them... I don't get overly upset. My current line-up includes the Jabra Elite 75T, Shure SE215-CL-BT, RBH EP-SB, RBH HP-1B, RBH EP3 and Audio Technica ATH-M50x.

Personally I feel the Shure SE215 are the best sounding of what I own (and very neutral). Also they are very comfortable. But they suffer from the battery pack and wire issue all IEMs of this design do. Next I feel my RBH EP3s are my favorite in terms of sound. They have a bit more bass than the SE215s but overall still a mostly neutral sound. The comply foam tips they came with do bother my ears after a few hours. The Audiotechnica ATH-M50x are tried and true monitor headphones and not much to add there. They are great as my everyday set for my computer.

But what I now use 80% or more of the time are my Jabra Elite 75Ts. While they don't sound as good as my Shure SE215s or by RBH EP3... for the day to day listening I do 90% of the time they sound great! And they are super super comfortable to my ears. I can wear them all day without discomfort and they stay in!. The microphones for calls work really well (though I've never had a ear piece for calls that I was totally in love with). The passthrough feature is solid and the Jabra software is well done. Very happy with the battery life to. What wins out is the convenience. The size and no wires and no battery pack just makes these so easy to use... it's hard to go grab one of my other pairs. One of my favorite audio purchases to date (and I've bought a lot of stuff over the years).",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on June 16, 2020",0,Verified Purchase,

2.0 out of 5 stars,Stefan,N/A, So many problems I don't even know where to start,"My perspective is coming to the Jabra Elite 75T from AirPods v1. I was trying to get better mic quality and battery life, I've used my AirPods so much they last under an hour on calls.

- OK, I guess I do know where to start. Fit is very uncomfortable, even the smallest tips hurt and didn't get better over a period of a week as I tried to get used to this. With Airpods I forget they're in. With these, I was always relieved to take them out.
- When making phone calls, the audio would often play only through the left ear. Taking out the left earbud and re-inserting it often reset things so it would play through both earbuds.
- The hear-through feature where it uses the microphones to let you hear ambient sounds works okay, but there is a significant background noise (like white noise) when using this feature. It's annoying when the ambient is quiet.
- My voice always sounds muffled to me when I talk with both headphones in. The feature that lets you hear your own voice during calls helps a bit, but it's still bad.
- Continual disconnections with the phone, it would cut out for a second or two - at least a few times an hour.
- Supposed wind cancellation and background noise cancellation is poor, people on the other end of my calls described a sound like thunder when there was wind. It was worse than Airpods that don't advertise special wind-cancellation features.
- Dual-pairing is extremely annoying, when I walk away from my laptop it constantly disconnects/reconnects, announcing that fact every single time, even if I'm standing still somewhere. It's like nobody ever thought about what happens if you walk away from your laptop and have an intermittent connection. I couldn't even find a way to turn off dual pairing.
- When paired to my phone, if audio was playing through the laptop, I couldn't access headphone settings using the app on my phone. The app said ""can't connect"". So if I was on a video call on my laptop I couldn't try different EQ settings or other settings that aren't accessible by tapping the buttons on the earbuds.
- Pairing to additional devices (like nvidia shield) was problematic, often had to re-enter pairing mode, or pairing would fail. This is never a problem with Airpods. I don't know why Airpods should pair better to non-apple devices than these do - maybe something about the dual-pairing feature messed things up when pairing to a third device.
- Setup instructions didn't work. Turns out the headphones arrived with completely dead batteries, took a while to figure out what the issue was.
- Firmware won't update if battery is low on the case. The app and instructions didn't explain this, the firmware update just kept failing without saying why.",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on June 4, 2020",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,

This is very annoying and havent found a fix yet. I may need to return these. I have not used them much in 1 week. Have not dropped them. Not sure what is happening.

Found a solution to my left ear bud not working. Put it in case,open case, and press/hold both buttons for 3+ seconds. remove from case and they should now work.

These are my 1st ear buds. I got them today. I must say that they sound 10 times better than my over ear JBL that i had. AMAZINNNNNGGG sound quality. I am very picky with sound and these are outstanding. The comfort of these ear buds also blow me away with all the nice features as a plus. I am so glad I got these. They are amazing. Hope they last long. I hear people complain about hissing sound on the left ear bug, i experienced the same issue. I did some testing and noticed that the hear through was turned off completely. I tried turning it on a notch and it magically fixed the issue, yes it fixed the issue completely. So that can be a workaround for all that are experiencing this issue.

* Conecta super bem com o PC e celular! Celular √© so conectar pelo bluetooth e baixar o ""Sound+"" e seguir as instru√ß√µes. PC tive certa dificuldade na conexao no meu Dell pq o PC nao reconhecia ele como headset mas consegui conectar ele quando cliquei na barra de tarefas na parte de notifica√ß√£o e, em seguida, em ""Connect"". Ai o pc reconheceu ele como headset e desde entao esta perfeito.
* A voz sai muito nitida - sem diferen√ßa entre falar do celular ou PC e o jabra - meu headset anterior a voz saia meio robotizada mas com o jabra √© perfeita! Ainda que tenha vozes de fundo....ela sai otima. So um detalhe....se as vozes de fundo forem muitas que dificultem at√© a falar no celular ou no PC....tmbem vao atrapalhar no jabra (Ele n√£o faz milagre!! rs)

Contra:
* Xiado ""leve"" no fone esquerdo - Constatado por outros usuarios ate no 65t (Versao anterior).

Provavelmente deve ser um problema do software e nao do hardware em si - um problema recorrente que ainda n√£o foi acertado mas que pode vir uma atualiza√ß√£o e consertar.

Mas se o objetivo √© comprar para liga√ß√µes/reunioes pelo celular ou PC n√£o faz diferen√ßa...√© imperceptivel ou nem existe.

2.0 out of 5 stars,GaXve,N/A, Good for almost everything BUT they're not secure in ear,"The sound that comes out of these earbuds is really exceptional, good bass and full sound. It connects to multiple devices at the same time, which I'm not a big fan of though. It connects automatically, and when a device is at the range limit, the earbuds connect and disconnect continuously. I suspect this drains the battery prematurely. For calls, your voice sounds really good for the other party (perhaps the best sounding earbuds in the business). The sound you hear on calls, on the other hand, is average / underwhelming. Controls are plentiful, the earbuds detect when you take only one out of your ear, and pauses playback (which I have to admit, I was impressed). Of all the earbuds, these are the ones I would have chosen IF they had ear hooks (NO EAR HOOKS). Other reviews have stated that they stay in ear without any issues. This has not been true for me. Going to the gym, they fell out, and just in normal usage, there was a wiggle in wearing them (It drove me nuts! Such good earbuds, and the experience was ruined by one little detail). It's a shame, just one extra piece of rubber to secure them in ear, and I would have kept them.",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on February 29, 2020",0,Verified Purchase,

Bad - sound quality is worse than the 65t. Mid range is gutless and high range is tinny. Bass is fine, but everything else was sacrificed. Stock ear tips are still not great. The 75t does not fit my ear as securely as the 65t.

Ugly - Sadly my pair was plagued with bugs and performance inconsistencies. Someone's the buds would not charge while in the case. Hear-through would activate automatically during calls, making the caller very difficult to hear. Sometimes the buds would go out of sync with eachother, so pressing play would play through one and pause the other and vice versa. Sometimes playback would stop completely, even though the connection was still active and the song was still playing in the app.

Conclusion - the vast array of bugs and inconsistencies coupled with disappointing sound performance makes these a NO for me.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Half Empty,N/A, A good fit depending on your use case.,"Finally took the plunge into the true wireless market with the 75Ts, and my experience has been a mixed bag. Primary use cases: daily driver for gym and commuting.

Pros:
* Compact earbud and case design.
* Stable in-ear for both cardio and weight-training.
* Strong battery life with case, although the buds last closer to 6 vs. the advertised 7.5 hours.
* Able to connect to x2 devices simultaneously.
* Passive noise cancellation is decent, and opting out of ANC results in better battery life... a worthwhile trade.

Cons:
* FREQUENT bluetooth disconnects that are a legitimate deal-breaker. Given the price tag, you'd expect a more stable connection vs. $30 wireless earbuds... no such luck.
* Slight, but consistent, background hissing.
* Default bass is overwhelming, but EQ-ing is possible with the app.
* Hearthrough function is noisy and useless in windy conditions.
* No wireless charging for case.

With all the unexpected hiccups, this feels like more of a beta product than the 65T.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Ian,N/A, Who knew earbuds could sound so good? And they're wireless!,"A few years ago, I ditched ear buds altogether in favor of over-ear headphones and never looked back. But their shortcomings have finally taken a toll on me: they're not so convenient to take everywhere; they won't stay on during a good cardio workout; they don't make for great hands-free headsets; and in the cold winter months, I fear the weather may damage them (although they do keep my ears warm). So I set out to find some buds to see if I could get those lifestyle improvements at the expense of sound quality, found these, and was blown away! They sound *almost* as good as my over-ears and far better than I'd ever thought buds could; their case is a very comfortable pocket-size; they fit snugly in my ears and hang in despite sharp head movements when skipping rope, shadow-boxing and working a bag; call recipients can hear me clearly even when walking next to busy city streets; and there's room to wear a toque on those -20C Canadian winter days.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,N/A," Amazing, but with recurring issues","These earbuds have fantastic sound, looks, comfort and battery, but with one huge issue - the left earbud hisses and crackles like the driver is blown.

I tried 2 pairs and both had the same exact problem. Above about two-thirds volume, the left earbud (specifically) starts to hiss and it crackles at certain higher frequencies. If you check Reddit, you will see a plethora of people saying the exact same thing about the 65T model as well. The issue is that this doesn't seem to be getting fixed by any of Jabra's firmware updates because the problem has existed for over a year and has now been passed on to the 75T model.

It's such a shame because they are otherwise the -perfect- wireless earbuds with incredible sound (when they aren't hissing/crackling).

I like the manual light-touch buttons on each earbud that helps me reduce or increase noise, pause & play my music. The battery life of the earbuds is very good and so is the quality of the case. The small lights on the buds and the case highlight the charge levels in forms of red, amber, and green.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Walter Beauchamp,N/A, High Quality Earbuds. Amazing Sound. Very Pleased,"Before I bought these earbuds, I first purchased the ENACFIRE Future Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds from Amazon for $70.00 and I was quite happy, I decided to return them because I didn't like that the master was the left side, instead of the right. After hours of researching, I decided to toss some extra money towards a higher quality pair and I am so happy that I did. These blow away the ENACFIRE earbuds by a considerable margin, in nearly every aspect.

From the time you receive your new item, you'll already feel like you are receiving high quality earbuds, from the detail and quality of material, just in the packaging, as should be expected for the price. The updating of the software took longer then I anticipated; however, once it was completed, I was very pleased with the features. Some of my favorites were the ""Find My Jabra"" which uses a Google Maps GPS tracker, like you would find on a mobile device, I love how it lets you adjust how much ambient sound that is let in. This is especially beneficial for joggers as it's important for safety and security to hear what's around you, while you're listening to music.

The right earbud is the master and the left is the slave, which pairs to the right automatically. You can also connect up to; two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, So for instance, if you are listening to music on your computer while a call comes in, it will reconnect you with your phone automatically. I love that these have physical buttons rather than a touch sensor; the buttons are very easy to press and very responsive to your press, which do not move while in your ear, when pressed, unlike my previous purchase. Jabra, absolutely nailed it when it comes to controlling your music, and connecting calls. You are able to skip forward, backwards; replay songs, adjust the volume with a long press on the right earbud, a long press on the left to reduce. With a double press you can command, Alexa, which was a huge plus for me. Google also works with the appropriate voice command, ""Ok Google."" I'm sure Siri works also, I just haven't tested it.

I was expecting the sound quality to be slightly better then my ENACFIRE's, I was completely wrong. The difference was night and day. The volume was much louder and richer, the mids have much better depth, with a broader sound stage. The trebles sounded very crisp, and clear. The difference exceeded my expectations in quality, over price, Once you adjust the EQ to your liking, it literally sounds like a set of $200-$250 wired headphones, I was blown away, anyone that enjoys listening to music with a lot of bass; these shine. I noticed allot of people complaining there's too much bass, which is very subjective, and is confusing to me (Just adjust your levels to your liking). The EQ software provides you with the option to create your own personalized profile(s), which was intuitive, and easy to set up.

The fit was perfect for me, the standard rubberized inserts fit perfectly right out of the box, a simple 1/4 of a twist into the ear, secures them into place, a very well engineered design. There are three rubberized inserts to adjust to your liking, (s),(m),(l). I work out at the gym and go for runs quite often, these buds remain fit, and secure, regardless of my activity. I love the feature which allows you to control the amount of ambient sound that's let in, which goes through your microphone, the sound around you is amplified, which is very cool. This is great if you're at a coffee shop, you can still talk to people, order food even while listening to music.

The battery life is excellent, I listen to my music quite loud, (volume 8-9) I get about 4-5 hours easily without putting them back into the charging case. The case is incredibly small, it takes up almost no space in my pocket and has a very nice quality feel to it, with a nice quality magnetic close. The Bluetooth range is very good I can freely walk around my apartment while connected to my device in another room, with no connectivity issues. While watching video's, there is absolutely no lag, or lip syncing issues. The type-c connector was also a great plus, not only for convenience of use with my Galaxy S8+ charger, but also the speed in which it charges the device.

Cons: I would say at first you may find it difficult getting these buds out of the case due to the force of the magnets, and the small profile size of the case, which may take some time adjusting to. The software update hung up, which took over an hour, too long for my overanxious liking. I read about others online that had similar issues, which was easily solved by removing them out of the case, and restarting the process, slightly annoying, but certainly not a deal breaker. The left earbud does not work independently on it's own while making a call; without the right one being active. (This is very minor; considering, sound does emanate from both earbuds simultaneously, while on a call, or you have the option of using just the right earbud).

Overall: The real question is, are these worth the higher than average price point? For anyone that's interested in spending a few extra bucks for quality of product, and performance. you definitely get what you pay for. The extra features, such as the hear through feature, Alexa enabled, the EQ feature, four microphones, for a much better caller experience, was enough for me. The rest was just icing on the cake. Not only does this tick all of the boxes in terms of features and benefits. These are definitely worth the $200-$240 price point, in my opinion, especially if you've ever purchased Bluetooth earbuds at the $50-$100 price range. the sound quality alone makes up for the difference in price. If you are on the fence, I suggest doing some additional research online, there's quite a few reviews and videos on this product, which I have found to be very helpful, and accurate. The difference for me, with the better sound quality, and hear through function, I wear these twice as often as I did; my previous ear buds. No joke, I wear them everywhere I can.. I hope my review helps you.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uVWQe0ZbL.88.jpg

3.0 out of 5 stars,Ben,N/A, Poor latency and sync issues is a bit of a let down,"Lets start with the good:
1. Case is teeny tiny and fits anywhere
2. Great battery life
3. Buds are small, light, and fits securely in the ear
4. Call quality is great - perhaps as good as you can expect from any truly wireless bud
5. Good for sporting activity as it stays in the ear and has some water resistance
6. The bass is insane. BOOMY. It isn't for those like a tight crisp bass but for those like a big booming thumpy bass. Impressive on a bud.

And now the bad:
1. Left bud sync issues (that mysteriously solves itself..) This seems to be a problem with the Jabra Elites based on some googling of the issue I had. The right buds connect no problem, but the left ones goes in and out. It is stable for now.. but who knows..
2. The sound signature is unpleasant right out of the box. The bass is overly boomy and the highs are excessively harsh. This muddles the mids and makes the overall presentation annoying to listen to. Because it is so boomy, there's also a decided lack of tautness on the low end. Thankfully, the EQ can be set to lower both ends down which makes it a lot more pleasant. Soundstage is also on the flatter side but not necessarily a bad thing for some.
3. Latency when watching movies. If you watch a lot of movies and video content on your phone, these are terrible. It is like watching an 80's Chinese movie with bad dubbing. Mouth and sounds are so awfully out of sync. These would be good if you plan to use this more for music, conferencing/calling, and just going out and about.
4. Depending on your ear, it may not be that comfortable. The bud needs to sit right into the ear, so if your ear doesn't have the right shape it hurts. My left ear doesn't seem to enjoy it as much and starts to feel sore right from the start.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on December 20, 2019",40 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,

A) Sound very good. Lots of base, though Jim , from Jim's Review Room says that breaks in with time. Do they sound better than Sony wf1000mx3 ? I think they do, but maybe not ... Personal preference. yes ... I have the Sony's. Jabra is a lot cheaper. Maybe don't sound as good as QC35II , or Sony wh1000mx, but it's close, and that is not a fair comparison.
B) size - very small, with great fit. Charger is small too
C) Features - voice tells you what is happening. Announces calls !
D) calls very good !!! Better than Bose, Sony, Sennheiser... even over ear QC35II

I am very, very pleased .
FYI - I have QC35ii, and wh1000mx,Jabra 850",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on December 19, 2019",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,
4.0 out of 5 stars,Lin,N/A," Very bass heavy, good isolating seal and hear through is good. Some gripes though.","The 75Ts are very good truly wireless earbuds and they are an improvement over last years 65Ts. The sound signature is much more bass heavy this generation, but at least the app does have a functioning EQ to tune the sound to your liking. Sound isolation is slightly worse compared to the Samsung Galaxy buds but the 75Ts are louder at the same volume % setting. Hear through works very well, however when stopping and starting music hear through will turn off and then back on. This can create slightly discomfort because it feels like a sudden change of pressure happens in your ears.

Battery life is good, not best in class but still very good. The overall battery life is much better compared to the Galaxy buds because the case can provide roughly 2 charges to the earbuds before needing to be charged itself. A neat feature Jabra's app provides is that it will also tell you the battery % of the case itself. No wireless charging for the case at MSRP is a bit hard to swallow, since the Galaxy Buds are cheaper and provide a wireless charging case. Jabra expects to sell a wireless charging case later in 2020 which can be seen as a plus or just them being greedy and wanting to double dip with consumers. At least it's USB type C for charging.

The controls are good, I am not really a fan of touch sensitive controls so the buttons the 75T are nice. They don't require excessive force to push and give a satisfying click. The buds fit well in my ears and don't get loose during work outs.

My main gripe is the fact that the buds are using a master/slave set up, with the right bud being the master and left the slave. If you want to only use one bud, it must be the right one. There are rumors that Jabra might release an update to allow for each bud to be independent but I haven't found a reliable source for this rumor. If the hardware is setup for a master/slave I am a bit skeptical whether a software update would allow the left bud to work independent of the right.

TL;DR

PROS
Good sound, very bass heavy (but has functioning EQ), good app, intuitive controls, very good battery life, USB-C

CONS
No wireless charging case, can't use left bud independent of right, a bit too pricey compared to competition",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in Canada üá®üá¶ on December 18, 2019",6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,
5.0 out of 5 stars,JGC,N/A, Forget AirPods Pro. Go for these!,Forget AirPods Pro. Go for these! Smaller; bass sound is excellent; comprehensive button controls on earbuds (except no hands free voice assistant); super long battery life. Only downside? No wireless charger.
